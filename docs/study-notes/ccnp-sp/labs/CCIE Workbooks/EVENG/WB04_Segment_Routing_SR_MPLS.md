**Emerald AS 65100 (LDP → SR migration section):** PE1 (1.1.1.1), PE2 (2.2.2.2), P1 (3.3.3.3), P2 (4.4.4.4), ASBR1 (5.5.5.5), PCE1 (6.6.6.6 RR+PCE). Prefix-SID index = last octet of loopback.

> **Prerequisites:** IS-IS Level-2 backbone with **wide metrics** (mandatory for SR sub-TLVs) and /32 loopbacks already configured (Workbook 01). Wide metrics carry the SR Prefix-SID/Adjacency-SID sub-TLVs; narrow metrics cannot.

# Section 1 — SR-MPLS Foundation (5 tasks)

## Task 1.1 — Enable Segment Routing under IS-IS

**Question:** Enable Segment Routing MPLS under IS-IS on all Garnet core/PE nodes and confirm the SR data plane is active. No LDP anywhere in Garnet.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 1.2 — Configure SRGB 16000–23999

**Question:** Set a common **SRGB of 16000–23999** on every Garnet node so prefix-SIDs are globally consistent.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 1.3 — Prefix-SID index per loopback (match last octet)

**Question:** Assign each node's Loopback0 a **prefix-SID index equal to the last octet** of its loopback (P3=13 → label 16013, PCE=17 → 16017, etc.). Achieve end-to-end SR reachability with **no LDP**.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 1.4 — Verify the global label table & compare with LDP

**Question:** Show the SR global label table and explain how SR **prefix-SIDs (globally significant)** differ from **LDP labels (locally significant)**.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 1.5 — Adjacency-SIDs (protected vs unprotected)

**Question:** Examine the **adjacency-SIDs** auto-allocated per IS-IS adjacency and explain **protected vs unprotected** adj-SIDs.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 2.1 — Enable per-prefix TI-LFA on all core interfaces

**Question:** Enable **TI-LFA (per-prefix)** on all Garnet IS-IS core interfaces.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 2.2 — Verify backup paths pre-computed in FIB

**Question:** Prove that TI-LFA backup paths are **pre-computed and installed in the FIB** before any failure.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 2.3 — Test link failure with continuous ping (sub-50ms)

**Question:** Run continuous CE-to-CE (or PE-to-PE) traffic, fail a primary Garnet core link, and confirm **sub-50ms / 0–1 packet** loss.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 2.4 — Node protection vs link protection

**Question:** Configure and contrast **node protection** vs **link protection** in TI-LFA.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 3.1 — Explicit SR-TE policy (segment-list of prefix-SIDs)

**Question:** On PE3, build an **explicit SR-TE policy** to PE4 (12.12.12.12) that forces a non-shortest path — e.g. PE3 → P4 → P5 → PE4 — using a segment-list of prefix-SIDs.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 3.2 — Dynamic SR-TE policy (metric IGP/TE/latency)

**Question:** Create a **dynamic** SR-TE policy on PE3 to PE4 optimized by a chosen **metric type (igp / te / latency)**; observe recomputation when a metric changes.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 3.3 — PCE-initiated policy (PCE = 17.17.17.17 as SR-PCE)

**Question:** Configure the Garnet **PCE (17.17.17.17)** as an **SR-PCE**, have PE3 connect as a PCC, and have the PCE **initiate/delegate** an SR-TE policy.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 3.4 — On-Demand Next-hop (ODN) with BGP color

**Question:** Configure **ODN** on PE3 so an SR-TE policy is auto-created toward the BGP next-hop when a VPN route arrives carrying a matching **color** community.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 3.5 — Steer L3VPN traffic into an SR-TE policy

**Question:** Steer **L3VPN (VPNv4)** traffic from PE4 → PE3 into the color-100 SR-TE policy by coloring the VPN routes.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 4.1 — Define Flex-Algo 128 (delay metric) on Garnet

**Question:** Define **Flex-Algo 128** using the **delay (min-latency) metric** on all Garnet nodes and advertise the definition from a subset (definition can be flooded by one node but is typically defined consistently).


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 4.2 — Assign locator / prefix-SID per algo

**Question:** Advertise a **per-algorithm prefix-SID** for Loopback0 so Algo 128 has its own SID separate from the default Algo 0 SID.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 4.3 — Verify separate topology computation & use for low-latency path

**Question:** Confirm Algo 128 computes a **separate (delay-optimized) topology** and steer latency-sensitive traffic onto it.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 5.1 — Enable SR alongside LDP (dual-stack)

**Question:** On Emerald (currently IS-IS + LDP), enable **SR-MPLS under IS-IS** so nodes run **LDP and SR simultaneously** (ships-in-the-night), with no traffic disruption.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 5.2 — Verify both label types in the LFIB

**Question:** Show that the **LFIB contains both LDP and SR labels** during the dual-stack phase.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 5.3 — Enable SR-prefer (prefer SR labels over LDP)

**Question:** Flip preference so **SR labels are preferred over LDP** on all Emerald nodes.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 5.4 — Remove LDP completely & verify no traffic loss

**Question:** Remove LDP from all Emerald nodes and confirm **no traffic loss** during and after the migration.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 6.1 — Prefix-SID conflict (two routers, same index)

**Question:** Two Garnet routers advertise the **same prefix-SID index** (e.g. P4 and P5 both use index 14). Diagnose and fix.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 6.2 — SRGB mismatch

**Question:** One Garnet node has a **different SRGB** (e.g. P3 = 18000–25999 while everyone else is 16000–23999). Diagnose the impact and fix.


> *Try this yourself first. Solution available in `solutions/` folder.*

## Task 6.3 — SR-TE policy down (SID not reachable)

**Question:** An explicit SR-TE policy on PE3 is **Operational: down**. The segment-list references a prefix-SID label that is not reachable/valid. Diagnose and fix.
