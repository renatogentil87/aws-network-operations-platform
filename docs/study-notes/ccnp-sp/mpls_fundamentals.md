## Part 1: MPLS Fundamentals

### Chapter 1: The Evolution of MPLS
- MPLS is BGP Core-free - Routers in the backbone network doesn't need to run BGP, only CE-PE needs to run BGP. In the
backbone network routers can just run IP routing protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS. CE-PE runs BGP.
- Basic idea of traffic engineering is to steer the traffic to the best path, not necessarily the shortest path.

### Chapter 2: MPLS Architecture
- MPLS label is a field of 32-bits with a certain structure.
- First 20 bits in label value
- 21-22 is EXP bits for QoS
- 23 is Bottom of Stack Label. Unless this is the bottom label in the stack, if so this bit is set to 1.
- 24-31- TTL Bit to prevent routing loops
- FEC(Forwarding Equivalent Class): Is a group or a flow of packets that are forwarded along the same path and are treated
the same with regard the forwarding treatment. All packets that belongs to the same FEC gets the same label imposed by
ingress LSR. Basically if there is several packets to the same ip prefix, these packets will get the same label.
At each transit hop, the label changes (swap), but all packets belonging to that FEC still travel together — 
they all get swapped to the same new label at each hop. 
The label value changes per hop, but the path and treatment remain the same for all packets in that FEC.
- LSR creates local binding. It bings a label to IPv4 prefix. LSR then distribute this binding to all its LDP neighbors.
- The incoming label is the label from the local binding on the particular LSR.
- The outgoing label is the label from the remote binding chose by the LSR from all possible remote bindings.


### Chapter 3: Forwarding Labeled Packets
Label Operations:
- SWAP: means the top label in the stack is replaced with another
- PUSH: means the top label is replaced with another and then one more additional label are pushed onto the label stack
- POP: the top label is removed

If ingress LSR receives an IP packet and forwards it as labeled, it is called _IP-to-Label_ forwarding case.
- show ip cef: will show the tag imposed (label)

CEF switching is the only IP switching mode that supports MPLS, it needs to be turned on in Cisco devices with
ip cef command.
- show mpls forwarding-table [network[mask/length]] detail: shows all the labels that change on an already labeled
packet. show mpls forwarding-table 10.200.254.4 detail

- Cisco doesn't load balance labeled packets with IPv4. If there are 2 links, one labeled and another non-labeled,
Cisco use labeled path only.

#### Note:
When you issue the command: "no mpls ip propagate-ttl" on the ingress PE hides the entire MPLS core from end-user traceroute 
by setting MPLS TTL to 255 instead of copying IP TTL. The core becomes invisible — appears as a single hop. 
This is used by SPs for security and topology abstraction. Same principle as cloud networks hiding internal fabric.


#### Reserved Labels
- Label 0-15 are reserved labels. LSR cannot use them in normal case for forwarding packets
- Label 3: Implicit Null Label: An egress LSR assigned implicit null label back to the LSR neighbor to a FEC if it doesn't
want to assign a label to that FEC, thus requesting upstream LSR to perform a pop operation. Implicit Null label is also 
called Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP). Implicit Null label doesn't deliver EXP bit for QoS. It basically tells its
LSR neighbor to pop the label before forwarding the packet, so when the packet arrives at egress LSR, it does only ip lookup.

Ipv4 -> Label -> Label -> Label->Ipv4 <-Implicit Null Egress LSR Ipv4

Note: Cisco only advertises implicit null label for connected routes and summarized routes.

- Label 0: Explicit Null label: Explicit Null Label (O) can deliver EXP bit, QoS. Egress LSR look at label 0, it does a lookup
and forward the packet. This case egress LSR will see the label but it will do two lookups, one for label 0, remove it and then
ip lookup. 
- Explicit null vs implicit null produces identifical traceroute output, the difference is only inside the egress PE forwarding
pipeline - explicit null allows QoS classification via EXP bits before label removal, it never adds an entra hop.
Basically explicit null the egress PE receives the labeled packet with label 0, removes the label, decrement the IP TLL and forwards the packet.

#### Unreserved Labels: 
Because label value has 20 bits, the labels from 16-1,048,575 are used for packet forwarding. 
This is enough for normal IGP prefixes, running OSPF, IS-IS. Cisco default range is 16-100,000.
For BGP you may need more labels due to large prefixes tables, then you need to setup using:
- mpls label range min max 

#### TTL of Labeled Packets:
For SWAP: IP TLL is kept, MPLS TTL is decreased, when it hits the IPv4 look, it decreases the IP TTL.
For POP: Removes the label TTL, and decreases IP TTL
For PUSH: Add the label on top and decreses IP TTL Adding MPLS TTL.

#### MPLS MTU
If you know the number of label a LSP can have, you can modify the MPLS MTU with the command:
- mpls mtu _number_
Let's say 2 label of 4 bytes each would give you MTU of 1508.

#### MPLS Maximum Receive Unit (MRU)
Basically, changes the size that a packet can be forwarded on a link depending on the label operation. 
If POP: it has more room for packet because label was dropped, hence more room for packet.
If PUSH: it has less room as the label is added to the packet.
if SWAP: It doesn't change.

### Chapter 4: Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
LDP Hello messages are UDP port 646 on multicast address 224.0.0.2
- show mpls ldp discovery detail: See Hello Times and Hold Times
- show mpls interfaces: which interface LDP is enabled
LDP ID is the highest ip on the interface or loopback
LPD ID must be an ip that is in the routing table or else doesn't form LDP neighborship.

LSR tries to open a TCP Connection - port 646 to te other LSR, if it is up they negotiate session parameters, such as:
 - Timer; Label Distribution Method; Virtual Path Identifier (VPI)
 - show mpls ldp neighbor IP detail
 - show mpls ldp parameters

#### Note: 
When a router has multiple links toward another LDP router, the same transport address must be advertised on all 
parallel links that uses the same label space, for example: loopback address.
- mpls ldp discovery transport-address IP
- show mpls ldp/ip bindings - LIB on the LSR
  - in-label: refers to local binding
  - out-label: refers to remote binding
  - LDP identifier can also be found

#### MPLS IGP Syncronization: 
If LDP session has a problem on that interface, OSPF advertises the max cost on that interface to prevent packets from traversing
non-labeled LSP. Once LDP is back up then ospf removes the max metric from the interface and let mpls packets flow normally.
For fast failure detection requires tuned IGP timers or BFD. MPLS convergence time = IDP detection time + SFP computation + LDP update.

#### MPLS IDP Session Protection: 
When a network flaps, LDP and IGP has to establish adjacency and advertise routes and labels all over again.
This can cause outage on a network, and to avoid this you can protect the LDP session as long as there is another path to 
reach that LSR. LDP adjancecy is removed on the port that is down but LDP session stays up through alternate path.
- mpls ldp session protection [vrf name] [for acl] [duration seconds]
You need to setup in both LSR, the other LSR you setup: mpls ldp discovery targeted-hello accept.
When the link between two LSRs goes down, the session stays up so LFIB still have the labels, the traffic flow follows different LSP, 
but once the link is back up, the labels are already there, no need to rebuild the LFIB. Traffic might failover depending on IGP settings.


### Chapter 6: Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF)
- Packets can be forwarded through the router in three basic ways: 1/Process switching, 2/ Interrupt switching, 3/ASIC (application specific integration circuit)
- _Process switching_: the slowest of all switching methods. When switching a packet throguh the router, a Cisco IOS process copies of the packet to CPU memory
and looks up at destination IP in the routing table.
- _Fast Switching_: Build a cache called IP Fast Switching route cache. Some timers govern cache entry. If a packet doesn't traverse the switching 
table for a while its removed from cache.
- Build on demand as packets traverse the router. -- show ip cache verbose to see the cache table.

- _CEF Switching_: Switching table is no longer build on demand, built in advance.
- Each prefix in the routing table has an entry in the CEF switching table at the same time.
- CEF Swtiching has two main data structures: FIB(Forwarding Information Base or CEF table); Adjacency table
- The adjacency table is responsible for MAC or L2 rewrite. The L2 rewrite string contains the new L2 header that is used on the
forwarded frame. For Ethernet, this is the new destination and source mac-address and the ethertype.
- An important aspect of the CEF table is that recursive prefixes are immediatelly used. If, for instance, a BGP prefix is in the routing table and it
points to a BGP next-hop - which is learned via IGP - the BGP prefix is inserted into the CEF table with the next-hop that is learned from recursing 
to the BGP next hop.

- show ip bgp 10.10.10.10 - next-hop 100.100.100.100
- show ip cef 10.10.10.10 - next-hop 2.2.2.2 eth0/0 label 23
- show ip cef 100.100.100.100 - next-hop 2.2.2.2. eth0/0 

_Load Balacing_: 1/Per Packet: The load balancing of all packets is round-robin per packet on the outgoing links.
- ip load-sharing per-packet - and you need to configure this command on all the outbound interfaces if you want to configure per-packet CEF load balancing.
- default behavior is per destination, sourceip, destinationip.
Cisco IOS can load-balance in CEF by hashing the source and destination IP address and pointing the result of that hash to a load sharing table.
- This table holds 16 buckets, each of the 16 hash buckets points to one adjacency, and multiple buckets can point to the same adjacency.
- show ip cef x.x.x.x internal / show ip cef exact-route source_address destination_address 
16 hash buckets exist. These hash bucketd distribute the load of traffic among all possible outgoing paths in the best possible way. 
For example: In the case of 2 outgoing paths, 8 hash buckets are assigned to each outgoing path. In the case of 3 outgoing path, 5 hash buckets
are assigned and one bucket is unassigned.
- Each bucket has an outgoing interface, so for each src+dst it hashes to a bucket, so every packet with that src+dst will go to the same bucket which has the same outgoing interface

## Part 2: Advanced MPLS Topics

### Chapter 7 - MPLS VPN
- RD: Route Distinguisher: resolve the problem of having overlapping ip by assigning a unique identifier to destinguish the same prefix from different customers.
- RD is 64-bit field used to make VRF prefixes unique when MP-BGP carries them. 
- Two formats: ASN:nn or ip-address:nn

- RT: Route Target: The communication between sites (Customers A, B, C) is controlled by RTs.
- RT is a BGP extended community that indicates which routes should be imported from MP-BGP into the VRF. 
- Exporting an RT means that the export vpnv4 routes receives an additional BGP extended community
- VRF-to-VRF traffic has two labels in the MPLS network. The TOP label is the IGP label and it is distributed
by LDP or RSVP for TE between all P and PE routers hop by hop. The bottom label is the VPN Label that is advertised
by MP-BGP from PE to PE. P routers use the IGP label to forward the packet to the correct egress PE router. The egress PE
router uses the VPN Label to forward the ip packet to the correct CE router.

- BGP Multiprotocol extensions and capabilities. BGP peers send each other the capabilities that they support. The ones
both peer share can then be used. 
- Sends an Open Message to its peer, it includes the capability optional parameter, listing all capabilities of this BGP peer
- show ip bgp neighbors can show the capabilities

- Multiprotocol Extension for BGPv4 define two new BGP Attributes:
  - Multiprotocol Reachable NLRI
  - Multiprotocol Unreachable NLRI
- These attributes advertise or withdrawn routes. both of them hold two fields. Address Family Identifier (AFI) and 
Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).
- Basically it tells what is being carried. AFI could be Ipv4, IPv6, AppleTAlk. SAFI can be multicast, ipv4 and label.

#### Note: Only BGP extended communities are sent by default to the vpnv4 neighbors. If you want to use standard communities
you need to use send-community both for the bgp neighbor.

#### Route Reflectors
- An RR is a BGP speaker that reflects routes from other BGP speaker.
- If you want to use RR with MPLS VPN, the RR should reflect vpnv4 prefixes, which carry labels. RRs only change the label if
they become the next-hop for the routes, which they usually do not.
- RRs differ in another way from the other BGP speakers in the MPLS VPN network. They don't inject vpnv4 routes when RT is not
configured for acceptance on the RRs.
- debug ip bgp vpnv4 unicast updates in - shows the capabilities 

RR Group: You can group RR and combine which one accepts routes. This can help scale the network by creating groups of RR
that knows about specific routes.
- bgp rr-group NN
- ip extcommunity-list 1 permit rt 1:1
- ip extcommunity-list 1 deny rt 1:2
This example, the group 1 would receive prefixes from 1:1 but deny from 1:2

### Chapter 8: MPLS Traffic Engineering
### Notes
- MPLS TE provides efficient spreading of traffic throughout the network, avoiding underutilized or overutilized link.
- MPLS TE takes into account the configured bandwidth of the links
- MPLS TE takes links attributes into account (delay, jitter, metric)
- MPLS TE adapts automatically to changing bw and links attributes. It's source based routing is applied to the traffic
engineered load as opposed to IP destination-based routing.

A TE tunnel is unidirectional, because LSP is unidirectional and it has the configuration only on the head end LSR and not on the 
tail end LSR of the LSP.
- TE Database is built from the TE information that the link state protocol sends. This database contains all the links that are enabled
for MPLS TE and their characteristics or attributes. From this MPLS TE database, path calculation (PCALC) or Constrained SPF (CSPF) 
calculates the shortest route that still adheres to all constraings(most importantly, BW) from the head end LSR to the tail end LSR.

- RSVP Path Message:
- When a head end router needs to reserve a path it sends a RSVP PATH message to the next-hop. The next P router will put that BW 
in standby and forward upstream another RSVP Path message. When the RSVP PATH reaches the tail-end it respond back with RESV
message and the label = POP/NUMBER, that RESV Message is forwarded back to the head-end router with a label with outgoing interface.
- The head end use CSPF to find the best and use RSVP to reserve the BW along the path

### Note:
- In some Cisco IOS uses default of 75% of BW available on the interface if any given when configuring rsvp interface command.

There are three ways to configure the tunnel: Dynamic, Explicit (Static), and Semi Dynamic
- Dynamic let's the MPLS-TE router define the path based on the requirements configured on tunnel interface and rsvp interface.
It uses info from type-10 LSA(OSPF) to know the BW available and which path can be selected based on the tunnel bw configured. (PCALC)
- Static (Explicit) - The network operator directly define the path the network will take.
- Semi-Dynamic - You let Dynamic select the path but you put constraints into it, such as exclude some paths from its calculation or 
manually define some paths alongside of dynamic.

on RSVP PATH Message there is BW, ERO (Explicit Route Object) add the next hop.

OSPF OPAQUE LSAs
- LSA Type 9 - Link SLA - can only be advertised locally - Opaque Link
- LSA Type 10 - Area LSA - it is advertised all the area - Opaque AREA. It advertises the contraints of the link in the area.
- LSA Type 11 - Inter-Area - can be advertised across areas - Opaque-AS

Type 10 - 2 type of TLV (Type Length Value):
- Route Address TLV: Loopback Address
- Link State TLV: It contains sub-TLVs - these TLVs are interfaces running MPLS TE

Sub TLVS:
- Sub TLV 1: Contains the link type (point-to-point or multiaccess)
- Sub TLV 2: contains the router id neighbor for p2p or DR id for multi-access
- Sub TLV 3:  Local interface IP address
- Sub TLV 4: Remote interface ip address
- Sub TLV 5: Admin Metric - TE Metric, specify the TE metric
- Sub TLV 6: Max BW - max bw can be used on this link, whatever configured with BW command.
- Sub TLV 7: Max reservable BW - default is the same as interface bw
- Sub TLV 8: Unreserved BW - value is the BW can be reserved with different priorities
- Sub TLV 9: Resource Class

RSVP: TSPEC: Tunnel Specifications - we need reserve of 1.200k
- ERO - Explicit Route Object - the path for the packet

Type 10 LSA contains several Links:
- 1.0.0.0 - local link, for example loopback
- 1.0.0.1 - first interface enabled for MPLS - TE
- 1.0.0.2 - Second interface enabled for MPLS TE

**Semi Dynamic Tunnels**
Two options:1/ Exclude address and 2/Loose Next Hop
 - Exclude a path, so dynamic selects the path but don't use/select another specific path defined on exclude-address. It is used when you don't want to use specific address for some reason.
 - Loose Next Hop: If you have two links or multiple links to the same router, loose next hop will allow the LSR use any link to reach the next-hop.

OSPF DOWN BIT: When a PE router redistribute BGP VPN routes into OSPF (to advertise it to CE when running OSPF (CE-PE)), those routes becomes OSPF LSA.
If CE is connected to another PE that also run OSPF PE-CE, the second PE would learn those routes via OSPF and redistribute them back into BGP creating a loop.
If a PE generates an OSPF LSA from a BGP route, it sets DN Bit (Downward bit) in the LSA option field. This bit says "this route comes from the VPN, not from a real OSPF domain"
- show ip ospf database external x.x.x.x

MPLS TE AUTO BANDWIDTH
Used to prevent waste on BW. When you configure a tunnel with a BW and that BW is not used, auto BW measures the traffic rates on a tunnel, it automatically reduces the BW of a tunnel
and assign more BW to another tunnel. 
- Sampling rate every 300 seconds, it calculates the rate of traffic.
-  Adjustment time - one day by default. It compares the rate of traffic from sampling rates, then auto-bw adjust the higher volume of traffic to the tunnel.
- to prevent issues when traffic is too low and might spike you can configure minimum and maximum values for the bw.
**Configuration**
- Enable Globally - mpls traffic-eng auto-bw timers [frequency]
- interface - tunnel mpls traffic-eng auto-bandwidth
Collect-BW: Auto-bw can measure the traffic tunnels, just calculating the bw, not applying it. Useful when planning to implement auto-bw.

**Affinity and Attribute Flag**
Add an attribute to the link so it can be added or removed from path calculation. Also known as link colouring.
- 32 bits length - hexa character starting from 0x00000000 - 0xffffffff
After configuring attribute-flag you setup the affinity in the tunnel hexa mask hexa.
- When mask = 1 it means the bit is important on attribute flag, if mask =0 not important
0x00000001 - attribute flag - this is equal to - 0000 0000 0000 000 000 000 000 0001 - 1 important bit
0x0000000f - mask - this is equal to - 0000 000 000 000 000 000 000 1111 - mas bit, the last bit is matching which is the important bit.
If the hexa doesn't match the link is excluded from the path calculation.

If the tunnel has affinity flag configured but the links doesn't then the tunnel won't come up as it is not matching the affinity flags.

**NOTE** By default, Cisco IOS doesn't trigger reoptimization when a link in the network is available to TE again, either by configuration or link is operational again.
To enable the optimization when a link becomes operational for MPLS TE: - mpls traffic-eng reoptimize events link-up

MPLS TE Administrative Weight (TE Metrics)
1. IGP Metric
2. TE Metric = IGP Metric by default

R1 - fa0/0 = metric 1 for Fastethernet
TE Metric is the same of IGP metric. MPLS TE always use TE metric to calculate the best path. Lowest TE metric is chosen for TE metric

MPLS TW HOLD AND SETUP PRIORITY
- 8 levels of priority - preferences
- 0 - 7 where 0 is the highest priority and 7 the lowest priority
By default, the setup priority is 7. Assuming a tunnel is using all BW and you configure a second tunnel, the 2nd tunnel doesn't come up.

Tunnel 0 - 500M - SP = 7 = OK = Data Traffic
Tunnel 1 - 500M - SP = 7 = DOWN - Voice Traffic

The priority gives priority to one tunel over another tunnel, for example above, if you chance voice tunnel priority, the tunnel will be prioritised.

HOLD priority is 7 by default
 - Hold priority of tunnel is up status is compared to setup priority of another tunnel that is trying to be established.

Common rule = setup > hold
Setup = 1, Hold = 0 - means " I need priority 1 to establish, but once I'm up, you need priority 0 to displace me"
When a router advertise unreserved BW in LSA or TLV, it sends the unreserved BW with the priority. 
If tunnel0 is 400K and link is 1000M then router advertises different unreserved BW per priority so depending on the BW of the tunnel can be established.

Example of tunnel preemption
Setup:
- Link 1Gbps (1000Mbps Total reservable)
- Tunnel A - hold priority 3, reserved 200Mbps
- Tunnel B - hold priority 6, reserved 600Mbps
- Total reserved = 800Mbps
- Total unreserved = 200Mbps

- Priority 0:
  - Can preempt hold 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
  - Can preempt tunnel A and B - 1000Mbps
- Priority 1:
  - Can preempt hold 2,3,4,5,6,7
  - Can preempt tunnel A and B - 1000Mbps
- Priority 2:
  - Can preempt hold 3,4,5,6,7
  - Can preempt Tunnel A and B - 1000Mbps
- Priority 3:
  - Can preempt hold 4,5,6,7
  - Cannot preempt tunnel A - 200Mbps
  - Can preempt tunnel B = 600 + 200(free) = 800Mbps
- Priority 4:
  - Can preempt hold 5,6,7
  - Can't preemt tunnel A = 200Mbps
  - Can preempt tunnel B = 600 + 200 = 800Mbps

If follows like that until priority 7.

MPLS TE REOPTIMIZATION
- Periodic by default = 1 hour
- Event Driven: When an interface comes back up after failure the tunnel re-routes. If a link change from down to up, the tunnel reoptimize
  - mpls traffic-eng tunnels reoptimize events link-up
- Manual - mpls traffic-eng reoptimization

Feature only for dynamic tunnels
- lockdown feature - we don't want to reoptimize the path, we don't want the change to happen in that tunnel.

MPLS TE AUTOROUTE - Another function to forward traffic to the tunnels, we don't need to configure static route or PBR.
You setup autoroute - mpls traffic-eng autoroute announce on interface and it will be advertise onto the IGP.

**MPLS TE Forwarding Adjacency**
It generates a Router LSA as the tunnel interface. So other routers in the OSPF/ISIS domain will see this tunnel link and depending on the igp metric may prefer
the tunnel to route traffic to the destination.

OSPF sees the tunnel as a link with IGP metric, other route include this link in CSPF. They can only see it a link when forwarding adjacency is enabled on both directions.

MPLS TE CBTS - CLASS BASED TUNNEL SELECTION
Used for QoS

MPLS LABEL = 32 bits [ Label (32) | EXP (3) | BoS (1) | TTL(8)]
EXP = Experimental  = QoS
BoS = Bottom of Stack
IPP - IP Precedence (IP header has ToS Byte - 8 bit length)
ToS - Type of Service 
- There are 2 important parts
  - IPP = 3 bits = 000,001,010,011,100,101,111 (bigger is better)
  - Bigger EXP faster than lower EXP
  - You can setup which tunnel a exp traffic will flow

QoS - Modular QoS CLI - MQC - ClassMap -> Policy Map ->. Service
Configure a master with member tunnels, the router examine the EXP on each tunnel and define which tunnel to forward the traffic

ToS = 000 = 0 = EXP = 0 
      001 = 32 = EXP = 1
      010 = 64 = EXP = 2
      011 = 96 = EXP = 3
      111 = 128 = EXP 4
      100 = 160 = EXP 5
      101 = 192 = EXP 6
      110 = 224 = EXP 7
- You are not allowed to load-balance traffic with the same EXP bits value onto two different tunnels with CBTS.

MPLS TE - Cost Calculation Process
Equal Cost Load Balancer - if the tunnel and IGP have the same metric, the tunnel will be used. If the destination is behind the tunnel tail then load sharing can be done. 
- Path Weight on output is the TE Metric.

MPLS TE AUTOROUTE ANNOUNCE METRIC
3 types of metrics:
1. Direct: It is the default TE metric (IGP Metric) or the manually configured metric with - tunnel mpls traffic-eng autoroute metric [metric] 
   Metrics behind the tunnel endpoint changes and impact the tunnel metric.
2. Absolute: For all networks behind the tail-end the metric shouldn't change. So when you setup absolute, you shouldn't change the metric to network behind the tail-end.
3. Relative: it means you can add or subtract the metric from IGP cost. For example if metric is 10, you can add 2 or remove 2 from the IGP metric to calculate the best path to a destination.

**MPLS TE QoS Models From IntServ to RSVP-TE**
Techniques used to implement QoS:
1. Best Effort: No QoS at all, all devices should give the best effort to send traffic.

2. IntServ (Integrated Service)- old days to implement it. works with RSVP.
Today QoS we don't use RSVP. All hops of the path works together to give the QoS on the path.

3. DiffServ (Differentiated Service)
It uses a technique called per hop behavior (PHB). Each router doesn't reserve the amount of bw.
It is used Queuing per hop instead and each router can implement a different type of QoS per hop.
Most used QoS today in the networks.
RSVP has another function which is label request. Called RSVP-TE

0 - Explicit Null - php remove the label but keeps EXP bit so php router knows how to treat the QoS for given traffic
- mpls traffic-eng signalling interpret explicit-null verbatim to change to explicit null in MPLS TE
- mpls traffic-eng signalling advertise implicit-null - router will send label 3 (implicit null label)

**RSVP-TE Messages**
RSVP PATH Message:
- RRO - Object that you can enable, you can see the path of RSVP Path, and RESV Message is passing.
- tunnel mpls traffic-eng record-route
- In the path message it records all the ip address that path message is passing through, you can see the path of rsvp path message
- The same can be seen in resv message when returning from path message

Two types of Label Distribution:
1. UD: Unsolicited Downstream: MPLS VPN, MPLS AND MPLS L3VPN uses unsolicited downstream method.
2. DoD: Downstream on Demand: downstream router should request label from the neighbor - Cell Mode MPLS and MPLS TE

When using LDP every LSR should advertise label to its neighbor without any request = UD
In Traffic Engineering, when we enable TE - Routers don't advertise label until requested = DoD - via path message/resv message

Label Distribution protocols: TDP/ LDP / BGP/ RSVP-TE

In MPLS TE we have important concept called Make-Before-Break. It is the ability of having a MPLS tunnel formed before switching the traffic on primary path.
First, it signals the new path, reserve the bandwidth and establish the new path, then it tears-down the first path.
This is called making the tunnel before breaking to prevent traffic being interrupted

Shared Explicit (SE Style)
- We have a tunnel with reserved bw. Old Path of TE LSP
- To establish the need tunnel we need the bw but it is reserved so it can't be established the new path.
That's when Shared Explicit Style comes into place. It's no double booking of bandwidth, the old and new bw requirement is not reserved at the same time.
- Because the shared explicit is running only for one time the Tail End understand the new LSP becomes from the old LSP and understand it can reserved the bw before tearing down the old path.
- The highest amount of bw is used. If old LSP has 1M but new LSP has 2M, only 2M will be used, no need to double booking the BW.

RSVP Messages:
- Path, PathErr, PathTear
- Resv, ResvErr, ResvTear

- Path message: is used to reserve the bandwidth, initial process and then it receveis back the resv message.
- PathErr message: is a message sent toward the head-end router. Used to notify the head-end router the path is not available anymore, it can be due to a link failure between LSP.
LSR can also receive PathErr with bogus information, different vendors, compatibility issues. 
- PathTear message: used when head-end router wants to shutdown the tunnel to other LSR in the path. Let's say we shutdown the tunnel on head end router, we notify other routes
that the link is tearing down. It is sent from head-end towards tail-end router.
- ResvErr Message: sent towards tail-end router, used rarely cases. It can't reserve the amount of bw requested.
- ResvTear Message: It is much like resv message, sent in direction as resv message, towards head-end router. Meaning the router is tearing down the reservation.
We don't need the reservation anymore.

- debug ip rsvp dump-messages to debug the rsvp messages

**Link Manager**
Link Manager is part of Cisco router that does link admission control, keeps track of reserved bw reserved by RSVP.
Runs on every router in the path. Tracks how much bandwidth is allocated per interface per priority. Decides admit/reject when an RSVP PATH arrives
In Path Message there is TSPEC = 64000 bytes/sec(example). Router needs to validate whether it has the requested bw to send path message forward to next LSR.
1. That's the function of Link Manager control, it controls the admission of the link, it keep tracks of the available bandwidth.
2. Another function of Link Manager, is preemption, it understand the priorities setup for the tunnel to preempt the tunnels.

3. Trigger IGP to flood link state information: 
OSPF (LSA) /ISIS (LSP) - Incremental Update: Router before advertise LSA to R2, only advertise in case there is a change in LSA, then we advertise the new LSA.
The same happens in ISIS (LSP). OSPF advertise the LSAs every 30 minutes, to ensure all routers receive the latest LSAs. Interval Update :30 min OSPF 15 min ISIS.
Routers need to advertise the change in bandwidth usage on the links. It can't be used Interval Updates because of longer convergence time.
There is a mechanism of tune the advertisement the link usage to other routers. If the usage is bigger than 50%, send LSA to other routers. This is function of Link Manager.

- OSPF ->  default is 30 minutes: router(config-router)# timers pacing lsa-group SECs
- ISIS -> default is 15 minutes: router(config-router)# lsp-refresh-internal SECs

Flooding by the IGP - Link Manager send flooding every 3 minutes with contraints of the links. It can be tuned: mpls traffic-eng link-management timers periodic-flooding SEC
1. Link State Change: A link change, interface added or removed from OSPF
2. Configuration Change: manual configuration of interface, cost etc
3. Periodic Flooding
4. Change in the reserved bandwidth: Manually changed the bw or updated bw on the link. 
5. After a tunnel setup failure: we setup the tunnel for a reason failure. The tunnel should be tear down and the bw should be released.

**show mpls traffic-eng link-management bandwidth-allocation interface_name**
Up Thresholds (available bandwidth increasing — tunnels being removed):
15 30 45 60 75 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 99 100
When a tunnel is torn down and available bandwidth goes UP, OSPF only re-advertises when it crosses one of these percentages of max-reservable.
Down Thresholds (available bandwidth decreasing — tunnels being admitted):
100 99 98 97 96 95 90 85 80 75 60 45 30 15
When a tunnel is admitted and available bandwidth goes DOWN, OSPF only re-advertises when it crosses one of these percentages.
Example: Link has 100 Mbps reservable. 
  1. Tunnel1 reserves 5 Mbps → available = 95 Mbps (95%) → crosses the 95% down threshold → OSPF floods new LSA
  2. Tunnel2 reserves 3 Mbps → available = 92 Mbps (92%) → between 95% and 90%, no threshold crossed → no flood
  3. Tunnel3 reserves 4 Mbps → available = 88 Mbps (88%) → crosses 90% down threshold → OSPF floods
Why it matters for CSPF: Remote headend routers make tunnel path decisions based on the TE topology database. If the database is stale (not updated), a headend might try to signal a tunnel on a link that's
actually full — RSVP will reject it. More aggressive thresholds = more accurate topology but more flooding. The defaults are a balance.

**Auto-Bandwidth**
Auto-bandwidth measures the tunnel's own traffic rate, not the physical link traffic. 
How it works: 
  1. Sampling: IOS periodically reads the tunnel interface's output counter (show interface Tunnel0 — output rate in bps). This is the actual traffic flowing INTO the tunnel.
  2. Collection interval: Every X seconds (default 300 seconds / 5 minutes, configurable with frequency), it records the highest output rate seen during that interval.
  3. Adjustment: At the end of the collection interval, it compares the measured peak rate against the current RSVP reservation:
    - If traffic > current reservation → signal a new reservation with higher bandwidth (up to max-bw)
    - If traffic < current reservation → signal a new reservation with lower bandwidth (down to min-bw)
    - If the difference is below the adjustment-threshold (e.g., 10%) → don't bother re-signaling
  4. Re-signaling: The tunnel does a make-before-break — signals the new bandwidth on the same or new path without dropping traffic

Auto-bw checks only Tunnel interface output counters. If the tunnel needs 80M, it will ask for that, it doesn't monitor the physical interfaces. Whether the interfaces
will admit that 80M request comes down to the link manager to admit it based on the interface utilization.
Think of it this way: if Tunnel0 carries 80 Mbps of traffic but the physical link has 900 Mbps free, auto-bandwidth doesn't care about the 900 Mbps. It just says "my tunnel needs 80 Mbps reserved" and
re-signals.
Whether that 80 Mbps can actually be admitted on every hop — that's the Link Manager's job.
If the tunnel request 10M but the traffic is 100M, the traffic won't get dropped, auto-bw will request for more link, link manager will try to accomodate, if it can that's fine 
and if it can't it respond with reseverr message it can't accomodate that request.

**MPLS TE Fast ReRoute (FRR)**
**Link Protection**
With Link Protection one particular link used for TE is protected. This means that all TE tunnels that are crossing this link are protected by one backup tunnel.
Head-end router has a tunnel with tail end router. It configures a tunnel backup.

R1 -> R2 ---------> R3
          ---R4 --> R3.
Let's say R1 has a tunnel with link protection, R2 is called PLR and R3 MP(Merge Point)
PLR detects the link failure and automatically uses a backup tunnel through a different link, protecting the whole tunnel from head end router to tail end router.
PLR Point of Local Repair
The backup tunnel is also called Next Hop (NHOP). 
When a head-end router of the protected TE tunnel receives the PathErr, it recalculates a new path for the tunnel LSP and signals it.
The backup tunnel doesn't reserve bw, therefore, when protected tunnels use the backup tunnel, it is possible that not enough bw is available to switch the traffic.
Backup tunnel is preconfigured on the PLR router:
- mpls traffic-end backup-path on the protected link
On the head end router of the protected tunnel, you specify that the tunnel can use as a backup tunnel. 
- tunnel mpls traffic-eng fast-reroute
  
! On R3 (PLR) — the transit router
interface Tunnel10 
 tunnel destination 4.4.4.4
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option 1 explicit name BYPASS-R3-R4
 ip unnumbered Loopback0
 tunnel mode mpls traffic-eng
interface FastEthernet0/0              ← R3's interface toward R4 (the protected link)
 mpls traffic-eng backup-path Tunnel10  ← "if this link dies, use Tunnel10"

**Node Protection**
You protect the whole router, not a single link.
It works by creating a NNHOP backup tunnel. When you configure the command - tunnel mpls traffic-end fast-reroute node-protect on the head end router
it sets the flag to Ox10 in the Session Attribute of the PATH message, indicating that it wants node protection

R1 - R2 - R3 - R4 
Let's say R1 has a tunnel with R4. in Link Protection R2 would be PLR in case of a failed link between R2 - R3. R2 would have a tunnel with R4 with explicit path bypassing that r2-r3 connection.
In Node Protection, R2 would bypass completely R3 and tunnel with R4 as backup.
For node protection, when a node fails, the PLR needs to know what label the NNHOP expects and this is done via RRO (Record Route Object) in RSVP

**SRLG - Shared Risk Link Groups**
SRLG is used when a backup tunnel can potentially be routed across a link that is on the same fiber or conduit as the protected link.
If you configure the protected link and all other links that share the same fiber with the same SRLG identifier, the backup tunnel avoids those links.
Two Keywords:
 - force: ensure that backup TE tunnel is never routed over a link that has the same SRLG as the protected link. If a link with another SRLG isn't available tunnel doesn't come up
 - preferred: indicates that if a link with another SRLG is not found first to route the backup tunnel across, the backup tunnel is created across a link with the same SRLG.

- mpls traffic-eng auto-tunnel backup srlg exclude [ force | preferred] (global)
- mpls traffic-end srlg NUMBER (interface level)
- show mpls traffic-end topology brief - see SRLG ids.

**Multiple Backup Tunnel**
Multiple backup tunnels can protect the same link or node, and they can terminate at different tail end routers.
They can be a mix of NHOP and NNHOP. the PLR prefers an NNHOP over a NHOP backup tunnel when assigning a protected TE LSP to a backup tunnel.

**MPLS TE and MPLS VPN**
- RSVP-TE replaces LDP for transport to the tunnel destination only
- BGP still provides the VPN label (always — regardless of LDP or RSVP)
- You keep LDP running for destinations without TE tunnels and as fallback
- In a full-mesh TE deployment (tunnel to every PE), you COULD remove LDP — but most SPs don't

**VRF-to-PE Tunnel**
Traffic from one customer goes to one tunnel and traffic from another customer goes to another tunnel
- The problem is that PE router receives an update with the same next-hop for two different tunnel and end up doing load balacing. To solve this problem you setup two different loopback as next hop so PE router
learns the destination with two different IP addresses to other PE loopbacks.

vrf definition NAME
 address-family ipv4
 bgp next-hop Int_name

That would tell PE to use different next hop for each VRF.

**MPLS VPN PE-to-P Tunnel**
we need to connect customer A to customer A in another site via VRFs, there are multiple paths via IGP.
You can configure TE Tunnel from PE to P tunnel to choose the path to send the traffic to steer the traffic and better usage of the bw depending on the cost of the igp.
The problem of establishing a TE Tunnel from PE to P is that the LSR will POP the label to the tail-end tunnel which is P, and that P won't know how to route the traffic to the destination.
Because they will have only VPNv4 Label.
- For this scenario, there is a must to configure LDP.
- P uses LDP to tell PE (Head End Tunnel) which label is necessary to be used in order to send traffic to P router (tail-end router). 
Now there will be two labels, vpnv4 label, and the LDP label which then allow communication to happen.
1. Solution: enable MPLS on the Tunnel Interface so the tunnel can learn label and how to forward labeled packets to P router.
In the capture, you will have 3 labels, VPNv4 Label, RSVP Label and LDP Label. LDP Label to forward the traffic to P router, RSVP to signaling the tunnel and vpnv4 to carry the vpn label.
2. Solution: Targeted LDP Session: so head-end receives the label from P router and knows how to send the labeled traffic, as long as mpls is also enabled on tunnel interface on head-end router.
   - mpls ldp neighbor x.x.x.x targeted ldp 

**SubPool and global Pool**
Subpool is like a premium capacity allocated to the tunnel. Let's say you have 100Mbps on the tunnel and you create a subpool of 50Mbps.
When a tunel is configured with subpool they can consume the 50mbps but it is guaranteed for them, it is taken from the global pool. Example:
tunnel 1 - global pool 100mbps
tunnel 2 - subpool 60mbps
Data flows 40mbps on subpool, so subpool still has 20mbps to server this tunnel, while global pool still have 40Mbps to allocate to its tunnel.
Global pool reservations are consumed only from global pool, and subpool only from subpool.

### Chapter 9: IPv6 over MPLS (6PE/6VPE)

### Notes
LDP doesn't support IPv6 as of yet.
- In networks that are running MPLS today, the labeled packets might be ipv6 packets, without the need for the P router to run Ipv6.
The solution 6PE and 6VPE are based on this.
- Another method to carry IPv6 in MPLS is Any Transport over MPLS (AToM). With this solution, the MPLS payload is a L2 frame.
On the edge LSR, the frames are labeled and then transported across MPLS backbone through virtual circuit or pseudowire
- Last method to carry IPv6 over MPLS backbone is to use MPLS VPN Solution, to carry IPv6 over IPv4, the CE routers need tunnels between them.
CE routers needs to be dual-stack routers.
- Following are the tunneling methods for IPv6 that you can implement with Cisco IOS today:
  - IPv6 over IPv4 GRE Tunnels
  - Manual IPv6 Tunnels
  - IPv4 compatible IPv6 tunnels
  - ISATAP tunnels

- 6PE is the Cisco name directly carrying IPv6 packets over MPLS Backbone
  - IPv6 doesn't belong to a vpn
  - no vrf interface on PE
  - All IPv6 CE routers can see each other as 6PE runs in the global address space on PE routers.

- Operation of 6PE
  - PE router are dual-stack
  - the ipv6 routing distribution between the PE routers is done via MP-iBGP. MP-iBGP distributes the labels to be used for the specific IPv6 prefixes.
  - This BGP label identifies or tags the IPv6 packet at egress PE. PE use label and LFIB lookup to forward traffic to CE router.
- Configuration:
  - enable ipv6 cef - ipv6 cef
  - enable ipv6 unicast routing - ipv6 unicast-routing
  - under ipv6 address family in BGP you tell the router to send label: neighbor x.x.x.x send-label

- 6VPE- IPv6 in VPN across MPLS backbone
Operation of 6VPE
- it has an MPLS core network running IPv4 IGP and LDP or RSVP for TE
- The edge LSR or PE routers are capable of running ipv6
- the edge LSR or PE routers have vrf that designate the vpns towards the customer CE routers
- full-mesh MP-iBGP session exist between PE routers - ipv6 prefixes
- IPv6 packets are transported with 2 labels: an IGP as the top label and a BGP(VPN) label as bottom label.
- PE and CE have ipv6 routing protocol between them.



### Chapter 10: Any Transport over MPLS (AToM)

AToM allows you to carry Layer 2 frames (ethernet, frame relay, ATM, PPP, any transport) across an MPLS backbone transparently.
The customer thinks they have a direct wire between two sites, but it is actually traversing the MPLS.

Key Components:

**Pseudowire (PW)**
- Virtual point-to-point connection between two PEs
- Emulates a physical wire across the MPLS network
- Identified by a VC-ID (both PEs must agree on the same VC-ID)

**Attachment Circuit (AC)**
- Physical interface on the PE that connects to the customer CE
- This interface becomes a pure L2 port - no ip address, no routing
- whatever frames arrive on this port get shoved into the pseudowire

**Targeted LDP Session**
- PE uses a special LDP session (not the regular link-based one) to exchange VC labels
- this ldp runs directly between the two PE loopbacks (targeted = no adjacent peers)
- It negotiates the VC label and pseudowire parameters

**Two Label Stack**
- Transport labe (top): gets the packet from ingress PE to egress PE (regular LDP/TE Label)
- VC Label (bottom): Tells the egress PE which pseudowire (which AC) to send the frame out

**Control Word (Optional)**
- a 4-byte header between the label stack and the layer 2 payload
- used for sequencing, padding small frames, identifying the payload type
- Required for some encapsulations (Frame Relay, ATM); optional for ethernet

HOW IT WORKS:
  CE -> Ethernet Frame -> PE -> Push VC Label + Transport Label -> P router MPLS -> PE -> Pop Labels forward new frame - CE

  1. R1 sends a normal Ethernet frame to R2
  2. R2 doesn't look at IP — just takes the entire L2 frame
  3. R2 pushes 2 labels: transport (to reach R8) + VC label (to identify the pseudowire)
  4. P routers swap only the transport label — they never see or touch the customer frame
  5. R8 receives the packet, uses the VC label to identify which AC to forward to
  6. R8 strips all labels and sends the raw Ethernet frame out toward R9
  7. R9 thinks R1 is directly connected on the same LAN

**IOS Configuration (basic)**
When you configure xconnect command, it automatically creates the target ldp session.
The only prerequisite is that both PEs have mpls ldp discovery targeted-hello accept configured.

  
On R2: 
  interface FastEthernet0/0
   xconnect 8.8.8.8 100 encapsulation mpls
   ! 8.8.8.8 = remote PE loopback
   ! 100 = VC-ID (must match on both sides)

On R8: 
  interface GigabitEthernet1/0
   xconnect 2.2.2.2 100 encapsulation mpls
  
  That's it — two lines per PE. The interface becomes L2, targeted LDP establishes automatically, VC labels are exchanged, pseudowire comes UP.

The PEs must agree on:
- VC-ID: PW never forms - PEs don't even find each other if different pseudowires
- VC Type (encapsulation) - PW DOWN - remote VC type mismatch
- MTU - PW DOWN - MTU Mismatch ( must be identifical on both sides)
- Control Word - PW DOWN - control word mismatch ( both on or both off)

Control Word controls the padding, the additional garbage bytes. If a frame is sent with 40 bytes, because the frame is 64 bytes, the router will add zeros until it
becomes 64 bytes, this is called padding. Then if that frame is sent to the CE it might confuse application, however, with Control Word, it records the size of the frame
in CW Length field and ask PE to strips off the bytes before fowarding to the CE so it doesn't get additional garbage.

#### Port mode: Entire physical port = one pseudowire. Carries everything (all VLANs, untagged, trunk) transparently — like a patch cable.
  
#### VLAN mode: One specific VLAN = one pseudowire. Each VLAN can be a separate service to a different destination — like slicing the wire per customer.

You can also setup tunnel selection by specifying which tunnel the pseudowire should use: 
- pseudowire-class pw1
  - encapsulation mpls
    preferred-path interface tunnel1

### Chapter 11: Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)

Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) emulates a LAN segment across the MPLS backbone across pseudowires or virtual circuits.
It is an evolution of Ethernet over MPLS, because EoMPLS is one-to-one, point-to-point, where VPLS is like a virtual switch. All PEs would learn
the mac addresses of other CEs, by replicating the broadcast and multicast frames to more than one port. It has dynamic mac addresses learning and mac-addresses aging

If a PE router receives a frame that has an unknown destination mac-address, the frame is replicated and forwarded to all ports that belong to that LAN segment. The 
LAN segment on an etherhet switch might be a collection of ports belonging to the same VLAN. When configuring VPLS, you must specify which VPLS instance a particular
port or vlan belongs to. 

If a CE router sends a brodascat frame to the PE router, the frame is replicated and forwarded to all physical ports on that PE router belonging to the VPLS instace, but 
also to all pseudowires associated with that VPLS instance.


VPLS Components:
1. VFI (Virtual Forwarding Instance)
- The virtual switch on each PE
- Contains mac address table + list of pseudowires to remote PEs + local attachment circuits
- Equivalent of a bridge domain or VLAN on a physical switch

2. Full Mesh of pseudowires
- Every PE in the VPLS instance must have a pseudowire to every other PE
- With N PEs: N*(N-1)/2 pseudowires total
- Signaled via targeted LDP (same as AToM) using a common VPN-ID

3. Mac Address learning
- PE learns source MAC from frames arriving on ACs and on pseudowires
- If destination MAC is known -> forward to specific AC or PW (unicast switching)
- If destination mac is unknown -> flood to all ACs and ALL PWs (except incoming)

4. Split Horizon Rule
- A frame received from a pseudowire is never forwarded to another pseudowire, only to ACs, physical customer facing ports
- this prevents loops in the fullmesh PW topology
- Without split-horizong broadcast storms would occur

With split-horizon: 
  1. CE1 sends broadcast → arrives at PE1
  2. PE1 floods to PE2 AND PE3 (via pseudowires) AND to any other local ACs
  3. PE2 receives the broadcast on the PW from PE1
  4. PE2 forwards to its local ACs only — does NOT send to PE3's PW (split-horizon blocks it)
  5. PE3 receives the broadcast on the PW from PE1
  6. PE3 forwards to its local ACs only — does NOT send to PE2's PW
  
  Result: Every CE receives exactly ONE copy. No loops. No storms.
 

**Signaling**
Same as AToM - targeted LDP between each pair of PEs:
- Each PE advertises a VC label per VPLS instance to every other PE
- VPN-ID (VC-ID) must match across all PEs in the same VPLS instance
- Full Mesh means: with 4 PEs, each PE has 3 targeted LDP session for that VPLS.

**Scalability Problem**
Full mesh = N×(N-1)/2 pseudowires. With 100 PEs that's 4,950 PWs. Solutions: 
1. Hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS): Split into hub (N-PE) and spoke (U-PE). Spokes only peer with hub - hub does the full mesh, reducing PW count.
2. BGP based VPLS (RFC 4761): Use BGP auto-discovery instead of manual LDP neighbor config. PEs find each other automatically.
  
**Configuration**
l2 vfi customer-c manual
 vpc id 300
 neighbor 8.8.8.8 encapsulation mpls
 neighbor 17.17.17.17 encapsulation mpls

interface vlan 100
 no ip address 
 xconnect vfi customer-c
 
it is also possible to tunnel protocols over VPLS network so customer network does look like a big layer 2 switch, by tunneling CDP, VTP, STP
There are two approaches to tunnel STP:
1. Tunnel STP (Transparent - customer controls STP):
   - PE tunnels BPDUs across VPLS
   - Customer's STP sees all sites as one L2 domain
   - Customers' root bridge blocks redundant paths
   - Risk: Customer STP failure can create loops across the SP backbone

2. Block STP( SP Controls it - default behavior):
   - PE doesn't forward BPDUs
   - Each customer site runs its own independent STP
   - No risk of customer STP affecting the SP network 
   - But customer can't run end-to-end STP.
  

**QinQ** **Dot1q Tunneling** 
QinQ adds a second VLAN tag (S-tag/outer tag) on top of the customer's existing VLAN tag (C-tag/inner tag), creating a double-tagged frame.
The S-tag identifies the customer/service to the SP, while the C-Tag remains untouched inside - letting multiple customers reuse the same VLAN IDs without conflict.

  ! PE/U-PE access port facing the customer
  interface FastEthernet0/0
   switchport mode dot1q-tunnel     ← enables QinQ (adds S-tag to all incoming frames)
   switchport access vlan 500       ← S-tag value (SP uses this to identify the service)
  
  ! PE trunk port toward the core
  interface GigabitEthernet1/0
   switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
   switchport mode trunk            ← carries double-tagged frames into the network

Result: Customer sends [C-tag 100][payload] → PE adds S-tag → frame becomes [S-tag 500][C-tag 100][payload] → SP switches based on S-tag only, never touches C-tag.

### Chapter 12: Quality of Services over MPLS

### Chapter 13: Troubleshooting MPLS Networks

**Traceroute in MPLS Networks**

Standard IP traceroute sends UDP probess with incrementing TTL. When TTL expires on a P router, that route generates ICMP time exceeded. The source ip of that ICMP
message is the interface address where the packet entered the P router - this reveals the internal MPLS topology to customers.

How traceroute works through MPLS (default behavior):
1. Ingress PE receives IP packet, copies IP TTL into MPLS TTL (this is TTL propagation)
2. Each P router decrements the MPLS TTL
3. When MPLS TTL hits 0 on a P router, the p router generates ICMP time exceeded
4. Customers sees every P router hop in their traceroute output

**TTL Propagation Control**
- no mpls ip propagate-tll
Configure on ingress PE routers, disables copying the IP TTL into the mpls label TTL.
- MPLS TTL starts at 255 (regardless of IP TTL Value)
- P routers decrement MPLS TTL, but it never reaches 0 in a normal-sized network
- Customer sees the entire MPLS Core as a single hop
- Both ingress-labeled and locally generated packets are affected

Customer traceroute will look like:
  1  CE → PE (ingress)
  2  PE (egress) ← entire core hidden, appears as one hop
  3  CE (destination)


There is another command: - no mpls ip propagate-ttl forwarded
Same as above but ONLY affects forwarded (transit) packets — packets coming from customers through the MPLS core.

- Locally generated packets by the SP (e.g., SP's own traceroute from PE to PE) still propagate TTL normally
- SP operators can still see their core hops when troubleshooting
- Customers cannot
  
! On ingress PE:no mpls ip propagate-ttl forwarded
  
**Important detail:** This only affects packets that get labeled at the ingress PE. Configure it on ALL ingress PE routers for consistent behavior.
  
- mpls ip ttl-expiration pop
  
When MPLS TTL expires on a P router and the router needs to generate ICMP Time Exceeded:
  
- By default, the P router pops the label(s) and looks at the IP payload to build the ICMP response
- mpls ip ttl-expiration pop controls how many labels are popped to reach the IP header for the ICMP reply
  
The nuance with VPN (2-label stack):
  - The P router has a packet with 2 labels (IGP + VPN). MPLS TTL expires.
  - P router needs to generate ICMP Time Exceeded. To do so, it needs to read the IP header underneath BOTH labels.
  - P router pops both labels, reads IP header, builds ICMP with source = its own interface IP, destination = original source IP
  - The ICMP reply needs to be routed back — but the destination is a VPN address. The P router doesn't have VRF context.
  - Result: ICMP might not reach the customer (P router can't route VPN addresses in global table)
  
This is why traceroute through VPN can show * * * for intermediate hops — the P routers can generate ICMP, but the reply can't find its way back to the customer CE.

**MPLS MTU**

1. Adding labels increases the frame size:
- 1 label = + 4 bytes -> 1504 bytes frame for 1500 bytes ip packet
- 2 labels L3VPN - 8 bytes -> 1508 bytes
- 3 labels (Inter-AS Option C, TE+VPN)= +12Bytes -> 1512 bytes
If a core link has L2 MTU of 1500 bytes, labeled packets between 1501-1512 bytes get dropped or fragmented.

The solution is to configure MPLS MTU on core interfaces: mpls mtu 1512
This tells the router to accept/send L2 frames up to 1512 bytes for labeled traffic.

2. Lower IP MTU on PE-CE interfaces to 1492: ip mtu 1492
  
Forces TCP MSS negotiation to smaller values. Impractical across many customers.
  
3. Rely on Path MTU Discovery — end hosts receive ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" and reduce packet size. Unreliable because many firewalls filter ICMP.
Best practice: Set MPLS MTU to 1512-1524 on ALL core-facing interfaces. Accounts for worst-case 3-label stacks.
  
Verifying:
- show mpls interfaces detail | include MTU
  
**Ping for MPLS Troubleshooting**
  
Testing MTU problems:
Test if 1500-byte packets pass through the MPLS core:
ping 8.8.8.8 source 2.2.2.2 size 1500 df-bit

Sweep to find exact breakpoint:
ping 8.8.8.8 source 2.2.2.2 sweep 1400 1510 1
Sends pings from 1400 to 1510 bytes, incrementing by 1
First failure = your effective MTU limit

Ping with record route: 
ping 8.8.8.8 source 2.2.2.2 record
Adds IP Record Route option — response shows every hop's IP address
Useful to verify the ACTUAL path taken (not just expected path)
  
**MPLS-Aware NetFlow**

- Netflow collects flow statistics. MPLS aware Netflow adds mpls specific fields to the flow records:
  - Label value (top labe, second label, up to 3 labels)
  - label position in the stack
  - EXP bits value per label
  - End-of-Stack (EoS) bit
  - Label Type (LDP, RSVP-TE, BGP, unkonwn)
  - Prefix the label is bound to

Why this is useful:
- Traffic forensics: which label carry the most traffic
- Capacity planning: per VPN traffic volumes
- Billing: charge customers per-VPN based on actual usage
- Troubleshooting: verify traffic is actually labeled (vs IP forwarded)

Configuration:
- interface giga1/0 
  - ip flow ingress
  - mpls netflow egress

ip flow-export destination x.x.x.x 9996
ip flow-export version 9 (Version 9 supports MPLS fields)
